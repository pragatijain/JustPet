<h3>Context</h3>

Opportunity

</p>
<p>
    As a part-time ACF start-up coach, I coached students for four seasons (one season is fourteen weeks) to develop their entrepreneurship, technical, and community outreach skills while identifying and solving a real-world problem.
</p>
<p>
For students, the end goal is to apply for and compete in the US Congressional App Challenge, and develop a personal portfolio that can be used for sharing growth stories in their college admission applications.

<h3>Problem Statement </h3>

During the pandemic, pet adoption and sales have soared. Pets fill in voids in families and individuals' lives with their companionship.
As per [this](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/15/2108941/0/en/The-global-market-for-Pet-Accessories-is-projected-to-reach-US-41-1-billion-by-2025.html
) report, the Pet market is expected to grow to $40 billion by 2025.

The JustPet ACF team wants to create a platform to connect non-profit organizations and pet owners looking to give away their pet products---finding new homes for used pet gear.
